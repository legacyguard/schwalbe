/**
 * TODO: Professional API Implementation
 *
 * This file needs to be properly implemented with:
 * 1. Correct TypeScript types from database schema
 * 2. Working supabase integration
 * 3. Proper error handling
 * 4. Authentication integration with Clerk
 *
 * Current issues:
 * - Missing or incorrect type definitions
 * - Broken service imports
 * - Incomplete implementations
 *
 * For now, this is a placeholder to prevent import errors.
