## Risk Assessment for AI-Generated Code

### Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Incomplete Implementations**: AI may generate placeholder code
2. **Hardcoded Values**: Check for development/test data in production
3. **Missing Error Handling**: AI often overlooks edge cases
4. **Security Oversights**: Authentication and authorization gaps
5. **Performance Issues**: Unoptimized queries and rendering
6. **Type Safety**: Missing or incorrect TypeScript types
7. **Integration Problems**: Third-party service configurations
8. **UI/UX Inconsistencies**: Design system violations
9. **Accessibility Gaps**: Missing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
10. **Internationalization Issues**: Hardcoded strings and locale handling

### Mitigation Strategies

- Comprehensive code review by experienced developers
