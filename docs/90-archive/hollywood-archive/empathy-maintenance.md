# Maintaining Empathetic UX Guide

## Overview

This guide ensures the caring, family-focused experience is maintained as the application evolves. Every team member should understand their role in preserving the empathetic personal assistant experience.

## Core Principles

### 1. Family First, Features Second

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Empathy Failure

If empathy score drops below 7.0:

5. Deploy fixes with monitoring

### User Distress Pattern

If multiple users report distress:

1. Identify common trigger
2. Deploy immediate messaging fix
