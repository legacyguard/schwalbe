# Hollywood Migration Implementation Status

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of the Hollywood migration plan phases, adapted for the current codebase structure after the web-next app was deleted.

## Phase Status Summary

### âœ… Phase A: Landing V2 (Next.js) - SKIPPED

- **Reason**: web-next app was deleted, Hollywood code moved to archives
- **Status**: Not applicable - landing page functionality moved to existing apps/web

### âœ… Phase B: Onboarding Engine - COMPLETED

- **Enhanced existing package** (`packages/onboarding/`) with comprehensive questionnaire
- **Added full UI components**: `OnboardingQuestionnaire` and `OnboardingPlan`
- **Integrated into apps/web** with routing and i18n support
- **Features**:
  - 6-question personality assessment questionnaire
  - Personalized plan generation based on user responses
  - Multi-language support (EN, CS, SK)
  - React components with TypeScript

### âœ… Phase C: AI Assistant (Sofia) - COMPLETED

- **Enhanced existing package** (`packages/ai-assistant/`) with context service and personality
- **Created Sofia UI components** for web app integration
- **Features**:
  - Context-aware responses based on user state
  - Knowledge base integration for common questions
  - Personality-driven interactions
  - Action buttons for guided navigation
  - Chat interface component

### âœ… Phase D: Dashboard Personalization - COMPLETED

- **Created personalized dashboard** (`PersonalizedDashboard.tsx`) with analytics
- **Integrated FamilyProtectionAnalytics** and milestone tracking
- **Features**:
  - User progress visualization
  - Next best action recommendations
  - Sofia chat integration
  - Onboarding questionnaire integration
  - Responsive design with modern UI

### ðŸ”„ Phase E: Stabilization & Cleanup - IN PROGRESS

- **Move stabilized code** from archives to production
- **Unify configurations** across packages
- **Update documentation** and remove unused Hollywood archive code

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with consistent design system

## Migration Benefits Achieved

### âœ… Code Quality Improvements

- **Systematic cleanup** of unused imports/variables in logic package
- **Proper TypeScript types** replacing `any` types where possible
- **Bundle size optimization** through tree-shaking friendly architecture
- **Error handling improvements** with proper validation

### âœ… Architecture Enhancements

- **Modular package structure** with clear separation of concerns
- **Reusable components** across different parts of the application
- **Context-aware services** for personalized user experiences
- **Internationalization support** for multi-language applications

### âœ… User Experience Improvements

- **Personalized onboarding** based on user assessment
- **AI-powered guidance** through Sofia assistant
- **Progress tracking** and milestone recommendations
- **Responsive design** for all device types

## Next Steps for Phase E Completion

1. **Archive Cleanup**: Move relevant Hollywood code to production, remove obsolete archives
2. **Configuration Unification**: Standardize tsconfig, eslint, and build configurations
3. **Documentation Update**: Update README and implementation guides
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for new packages
5. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle analysis and optimization

## Files Modified/Created

### New Packages

- `packages/onboarding/` - Complete onboarding engine
- `packages/ai-assistant/` - Enhanced AI assistant

### Modified Files
