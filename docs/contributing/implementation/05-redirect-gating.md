# Phase 05 â€“ Redirect Gating by VITE_IS_PRODUCTION

Wrap country-based redirect logic so prod does real redirects and non-prod shows CZ simulation.

Inputs
- SPEC LINKS: redirect gating requirement
- DOMAINS: active domain list to simulate

Kickoff prompt
```
SEATBELT: ON
MODE: IMPLEMENT
REPO: schwalbe
FEATURE: Redirect gating by VITE_IS_PRODUCTION
CONTEXT: Preserve switch/case by country; gate with env; simulate in CZ for non-prod.
SCOPE:
- Wrap redirect code in if (VITE_IS_PRODUCTION)
- Else: show CZ modal/toast with target URL for each domain
- Add QA checklist in docs
NON_GOALS:
- Modal redesign
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Prod: real redirects; Staging/local: simulation only
DELIVERABLES:
- Routing/app shell diffs; docs
CONSTRAINTS:
- UI English; simulation text Czech; no interactive commands
PERMISSIONS:
- edit code: yes; read-only cmds: yes; commit: ask
BRANCH: feature/redirect-gating
RISK TOLERANCE: low
CHECKS BEFORE DONE:
- Manual verification on CZ/SK

- New modal design
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
