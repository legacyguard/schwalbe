REPO: schwalbe
FEATURE: Top bar search UI using hashed index
CONTEXT: No plaintext term storage/logging; queries hashed client-side/server-side consistently.

- Integrate with query path that hashes terms with the same salt
- Avoid raw-term logging; add privacy-safe counters if needed
NON_GOALS:
- Semantic ranking/embeddings
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Results returned via hashed path; no PII leakage
DELIVERABLES:
- UI components; query integration; docs
CONSTRAINTS:
- Secrets via env; UI English; i18n for visible text
PERMISSIONS:
- edit code: yes; read-only cmds: yes; commit: ask
BRANCH: feature/search-ui
RISK TOLERANCE: medium
CHECKS BEFORE DONE:
- Privacy review; E2E query flow test
```
