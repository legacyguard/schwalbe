SEATBELT: ON
MODE: IMPLEMENT
REPO: schwalbe
FEATURE: Production env/DNS/robots/secrets + runbook
CONTEXT:
- Vercel project (apps/web) with environment variables

SCOPE:
- Configure DNS and HTTPS for CZ/SK domains in Vercel
- Add env vars for Stripe/Resend/Supabase in prod environment

- No secrets printed; use provider secret stores; keep diffs minimal
PERMISSIONS:

BRANCH: main
RISK TOLERANCE: low
CHECKS BEFORE DONE:
- Test prod URL health; quick smoke test of money path
