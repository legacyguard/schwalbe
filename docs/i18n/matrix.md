# Schwalbe i18n Matrix (Source of Truth)

This file is the canonical reference for languages and per-country rules used across specs.

- MVP languages: EN, CS, SK, DE, UK
- Production target: 34 languages (see rows below)
- Country rules:
  - Replace Russian with Ukrainian where specified by business rules
  - Remove Ukrainian from Iceland and Liechtenstein
  - Ensure a minimum of 4 languages per country; if fewer are available, add the closest language from the 34-language set

If you maintain a more detailed matrix elsewhere, keep it, but treat this path as the normalized reference for scripts and docs: docs/i18n/matrix.md.

TODO: Paste or link the full matrix content here, or add a script that generates it from your original source file.
