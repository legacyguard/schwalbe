# Schwalbe — Implementation To‑Do Tracker

This document is your authoritative checklist for rebuilding Schwalbe. It mirrors the phases and success gates from docs/high-level-plan.md, adds immediate security hygiene, and provides curated migration checklists from Hollywood.

Guidance
- Each item is a granular, verifiable task.
- Use [ ] / [x] to track status. Link each task to a Linear issue (e.g., LG-123) and PR when created.
- Do not proceed to the next phase until all gates in the current phase are green on local, CI, and preview.

Links
- Strategy and roadmap: docs/high-level-plan.md
- Specs and governance: spec-kit

Owner = who is responsible. Issue = Linear or GitHub Issue ID. PR = GitHub PR link.
