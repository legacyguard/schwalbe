Key Risks and Fixes (from Hollywood)
- Node.js version standardization (20.19.1 recommended).
- Tailwind CSS config fixes; robust build validation; consolidated pipeline.

React Compatibility Note
- Hollywood solved React 19 runtime issues by using React 18.3.1; Schwalbe currently runs React 19.1.1â€”verify compatibility or plan a downgrade.

Process
- Pre-deploy validation (type-check, tests, build).
- Environment var verification and secret management via platform UI (e.g., Vercel).
- Health checks and metrics; rollback plan.
- Document troubleshooting procedures.
