# Definition of Ready (DoR)

A ticket is ready when:
- Linked spec section exists with acceptance criteria
- Env vars known and documented (if any)
- Data model impacts identified (tables, columns, policies)
- Observability: logs and alerts planned (events, thresholds)
- QA plan drafted (manual/E2E, performance if relevant)
- Rollout/rollback noted if risky
