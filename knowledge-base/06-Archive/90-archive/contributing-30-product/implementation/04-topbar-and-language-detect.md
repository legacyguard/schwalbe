# TopBar and Language Detection Integration

This phase wires a responsive top bar with domain-aware language switching.

- Country menu lists EU markets; only CZ and SK are clickable during MVP.
- Language switcher displays only allowed languages for the current host.
- Manual language changes call i18n.changeLanguage(...) and are persisted to localStorage under 'lg.lang'.
- Initial locale is already computed from computePreferredLocaleFromBrowser() and remains the single source of truth at startup.

Implementation notes:
- Allowed languages come from getAllowedLanguagesForCurrentHost() which maps hostname → domain language subset.
- Country redirects are gated by environment: if production, perform real redirect; otherwise show a Czech alert simulating the redirect URL (per rules).
- All UI texts are in English except the redirect simulation alert.

Components:
- apps/web/src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx
- apps/web/src/components/layout/CountryMenu.tsx
- apps/web/src/components/layout/SearchBox.tsx (stub)
- apps/web/src/components/layout/UserIcon.tsx (stub)
- apps/web/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx (optional wrapper for global header)

Language labels:
- Mapping added in packages/shared/src/config/languages.ts as LANGUAGE_LABELS_EN and helper getLanguageLabel(locale)
- Language switcher now displays English names (e.g., Czech, Slovak, English, German, Ukrainian)

Active country indicator:
- CountryMenu determines current country by matching window.location.hostname via getDomainByHost();
- Falls back to DEFAULT_COUNTRY for localhost; the current country is highlighted and marked with aria-current.

# Phase 04 – Multi-domain Top Bar & Language Auto-detect

Purpose
Implement the top bar with required icons and language auto-detect with fallback.

Inputs
- SPEC LINKS: multi-domain/service bar spec, domains config
- INITIAL DOMAINS: CZ, SK

Kickoff prompt
```
SEATBELT: ON
MODE: IMPLEMENT
REPO: schwalbe
FEATURE: Multi-domain top bar with icons + language auto-detect
CONTEXT: Top bar mirrors nvidia.com style; initial clickable domains CZ/SK.
SCOPE:
- Header layout with icons (user/Clerk, country, search, support, buy)
- Country menu: list EU; CZ/SK active with redirect links
- Expandable search UI (stub) in header
- Support/buy routes
- Language auto-detect and fallback to EN
NON_GOALS:
- Full search backend
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Header responsive; domain links functional; language auto-detect verified
DELIVERABLES:
- Header components; routes; docs snippet
CONSTRAINTS:
- UI English; i18n 34; respect redirect gating
PERMISSIONS:
- edit code: yes; read-only cmds: yes; commit: ask
BRANCH: main
RISK TOLERANCE: low
CHECKS BEFORE DONE:
- a11y check; build pass; docs updated
```

SEATBELT: ON
MODE: IMPLEMENT
REPO: schwalbe
FEATURE: Multi-domain top bar with icons + language auto-detect
CONTEXT:
- Domain config: packages/shared/src/config/domains.ts
- Redirect guard: apps/web/src/lib/utils/redirect-guard.ts
- Vite alias: apps/web/vite.config.js (alias '@' → './src')
SCOPE:
- Create header components:
  - apps/web/src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx
  - apps/web/src/components/layout/CountryMenu.tsx
  - apps/web/src/components/layout/SearchBox.tsx (stub)
  - apps/web/src/components/layout/UserIcon.tsx (stub)
- Country menu lists EU, CZ/SK clickable → open computed domain URL
- Auto-detect language (navigator.language) and fallback to EN
- Wire language switcher to DOMAIN_LANGUAGES map (Phase 03)
NON_GOALS:
- Full search backend
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Responsive header; CZ/SK links open correct legacyguard.* domains (no redirect in non-prod)
DELIVERABLES:
- New components under apps/web/src/components/layout/
- Small docs snippet
CONSTRAINTS:
- UI English; respect redirect gating policy
PERMISSIONS:
- edit code: yes; read-only cmds: yes; commit: ask
BRANCH: main
RISK TOLERANCE: low
CHECKS BEFORE DONE:
- a11y pass for header; manual domain menu test
```
