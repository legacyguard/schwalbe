# Next.js Migration - App Router and SSR/RSC Implementation

- Complete migration from Vite-based React application to Next.js 14+ with App Router architecture
- Implementation of Server-Side Rendering (SSR), React Server Components (RSC), and Edge Runtime capabilities
- Establishes foundation for scalable, performant web application with modern React patterns
- Enables seamless integration with Vercel deployment and Supabase edge functions

## Goals

### Core Next.js Migration Goals

- **App Router Implementation**: Complete migration to Next.js 14+ App Router with file-based routing, nested layouts, and route groups
- **SSR/RSC Architecture**: Implement Server-Side Rendering and React Server Components for optimal performance and SEO
- **Server Components Strategy**: Migrate to server components for data fetching, reduce client bundle size, and improve performance
- **Edge Runtime Integration**: Configure and deploy Supabase Edge Functions with proper TypeScript support and middleware

### Technical Implementation Goals

- **Component Migration Strategy**: Develop systematic approach for migrating React components to Next.js patterns
- **Data Fetching Patterns**: Implement optimized data fetching with caching, ISR, and streaming for server components
- **Routing & Navigation**: Configure App Router with dynamic routes, parallel routes, and intercepting routes
- **Middleware & API Routes**: Implement Next.js middleware for authentication and API routes for serverless functions
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieve Core Web Vitals optimization with image optimization, bundle analysis, and caching strategies

### Infrastructure & Deployment Goals

- **Vercel Integration**: Seamless deployment with preview environments, custom domains, and performance monitoring
- **Build Optimization**: Configure code splitting, tree shaking, and build performance tuning
- **Development Workflow**: Establish TS config, ESLint, Prettier, and commit hooks for consistent development
- **Governance Setup**: spec-kit integration, Linear project management, and CI/CD pipeline configuration

### Migration Execution Goals

- **Phase 0 Bootstrap**: Scaffold Next.js app in apps/web-next, exclude Vite app from CI, establish governance
- **Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive testing strategy for SSR, client/server boundaries, and performance
- **Best Practices**: Implement Next.js patterns, error boundaries, loading states, and accessibility standards
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure all existing functionality preserved with improved performance

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Custom server implementations beyond Next.js defaults
- Complex middleware beyond authentication and routing
- Real-time features requiring WebSocket connections
- Legacy browser support below modern standards
- Advanced PWA features (service workers, offline support)
- Third-party CDN integration beyond Vercel

## Risks & Mitigations

- Migration complexity → Break down into small, manageable phases with clear acceptance criteria
- Performance regression → Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and benchmarking
- Compatibility issues → Thorough testing of all existing features before migration completion
- Developer learning curve → Provide training and documentation for Next.js patterns
- Build time increases → Optimize build configuration and implement proper caching
- Third-party library issues → Audit all dependencies for Next.js compatibility
