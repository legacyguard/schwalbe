## Implementation Guidelines

### **Development Principles**

1. **Security First**: All sensitive data encrypted client-side before transmission
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Each phase delivers working functionality
3. **Cost Optimization**: Minimize AI costs through intelligent routing
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop enhancement
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
6. **Performance**: Lazy loading, code splitting, optimal bundle sizes

### **Quality Gates per Phase**

- [ ] All new features have unit tests with >80% coverage
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode passes without errors
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier formatting consistent
- [ ] Responsive design tested on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Security patterns validated (encryption, authentication)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (load times, bundle sizes)

### **Testing Strategy**

- **Unit Tests**: Jest for business logic, utilities, and pure functions
- **Component Tests**: Testing Library for React component behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Test Sofia AI flows, document operations, auth flows
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical user journeys (sign up, upload document, Sofia interaction)
- **Performance Tests**: Bundle size monitoring, load time validation

## Risk Management

### **Technical Risks & Mitigations**

- **AI API Costs**: Implement strict cost controls and three-tier optimization
- **Encryption Performance**: Use Web Workers for heavy crypto operations
- **State Complexity**: Keep Sofia state simple with clear boundaries
- **Mobile Performance**: Lazy load components and optimize for low-end devices

### **User Experience Risks & Mitigations**

- **Sofia Overwhelm**: Start with knowledge base before full AI features
- **Complex Navigation**: Implement global search and contextual help
- **Security Confusion**: Clear explanation of zero-knowledge architecture benefits
- **Mobile Usability**: Mobile-first design with touch-optimized interactions

## Success Criteria

### **Technical Validation**

- Sofia AI responds within 500ms for knowledge base queries
- Document upload and encryption completes within 5 seconds
- Dashboard loads to interactive state within 2 seconds
- Mobile experience provides full functionality without compromise

### **User Experience Validation**

- New users complete initial document upload within 5 minutes
- Sofia provides helpful guidance without being intrusive
- Document search returns relevant results instantly
- User onboarding completion rate >70%

### **Business Logic Validation**

- Authentication flows work seamlessly across devices
- Client-side encryption maintains zero-knowledge architecture
- Sofia cost optimization keeps 80% of interactions free
- Progress tracking motivates continued engagement

## Integration with Existing Specs

### **Builds on 002-hollywood-migration**

- Requires UI components from `@schwalbe/ui` package
- Uses encryption services from `@schwalbe/shared` package
- Leverages authentication patterns from migration
- Depends on build tooling and development environment

### **Sets Foundation for Future Specs**

- **004-estate-planning**: Will creation, family collaboration, legal templates
