# Auth + RLS Baseline - Supabase Auth and Postgres RLS

- Implementation of Phase 2 — Auth + RLS Baseline from high-level-plan.md
- Clerk authentication integration with Supabase Row Level Security
- Session management, access control, and secure database policies
- Prerequisites: 001-reboot-foundation, 003-hollywood-migration completed

## Goals

- **Supabase Authentication Integration**: Comprehensive user management with email/password, OAuth providers, and JWT token handling
- **Supabase RLS Policies & Enforcement**: Database-level security with claims mapping, policy validation, and data isolation
- **Session Management & Token Handling**: Secure session persistence, automatic token refresh, and concurrent session control
- **Access Control & Permission System**: Role-based access control with granular permissions and inheritance rules
- **Role Management & User Roles**: Hierarchical role system with assignment, expiration, and audit trails
- **Security Hardening & Vulnerability Scanning**: CSP, rate limiting, penetration testing, and automated security monitoring
- **Auth Testing & Validation**: Comprehensive E2E testing, RLS policy validation, and security testing automation
- **Auth Analytics & Monitoring**: Real-time auth metrics, performance tracking, and security event logging
- **Auth Performance Optimization**: Sub-second response times, caching strategies, and database query optimization
- **Auth Accessibility & Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, GDPR compliance, and international accessibility standards
- Port Hollywood auth system patterns and middleware implementation
- Vertical slice: "Profile" table read/write behind RLS policies

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Custom authentication UI components (use Clerk's built-in components)
- Complex role-based access control (RBAC) hierarchies beyond basic user/admin
- Enterprise single sign-on (SSO) integrations
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) beyond Clerk's built-in options
- Real-time session synchronization across multiple devices

```

### Key Components

1. **Clerk Provider**: Root-level authentication provider with session management
2. **Auth Middleware**: Route protection and session validation middleware
3. **Supabase Client**: Authenticated database client with JWT token injection
4. **RLS Policies**: Database-level security policies for data access control
5. **Storage Policies**: File storage security with user-based access control
6. **Profile Management**: User profile CRUD operations with security validation

### Security Architecture

- **JWT Token Flow**: Clerk JWT tokens automatically injected into Supabase requests
- **Row Level Security**: PostgreSQL RLS policies ensure data isolation using auth.uid() as the identity source (Supabase Auth)
- For transitional schemas where user_id is TEXT, compare with auth.uid()::text. See docs/security/rls-cookbook.md.
- **Storage Security**: User-scoped file access with encryption
- **Session Security**: Secure session management with automatic refresh
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of authentication and access events

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics

- **Authentication Success Rate**: >98% successful authentication attempts
- **Session Persistence**: >95% sessions maintained across browser refreshes
- **Error Recovery**: <2% users require support for auth issues
- **Performance**: <1 second authentication response time

### Technical Metrics

- **Security Incidents**: Zero authentication-related security breaches
- **RLS Policy Coverage**: 100% database tables protected by RLS
- **Test Coverage**: >90% authentication and security code coverage
- **Performance**: <100ms average authentication operation time

### Business Metrics

- **User Retention**: >85% monthly active users with secure authentication
- **Trust Score**: >4.5/5 user trust rating for data security
- **Compliance**: 100% audit compliance for authentication systems

## Risks & Mitigations

- Authentication service outages → Implement fallback mechanisms and error recovery
- RLS policy bypass → Comprehensive policy testing and security audits
- Session hijacking → Secure session management and token validation
- Performance degradation → Optimize authentication operations and caching
- Integration complexity → Thorough testing of Clerk and Supabase compatibility
- Security vulnerabilities → Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning
