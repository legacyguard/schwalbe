# Document Vault - Encrypted Storage System

- Implementation of secure document storage with zero-knowledge architecture
- Client-side encryption with comprehensive key management and recovery systems
- Document management with versioning, metadata extraction, and intelligent search

## Goals

- Migrate and enhance document management system from Hollywood codebase
- Implement client-side encryption with TweetNaCl and zero-knowledge architecture
- Create comprehensive key management system with rotation and recovery
- Build document versioning and bundle organization system
- Establish metadata extraction with OCR and AI-powered categorization
- Implement full-text search across encrypted content
- Create secure document sharing with granular permissions
- Integrate with Sofia AI for document insights and user guidance
- Establish audit logging and compliance features
- Migrate DocumentUploader component with drag-and-drop functionality
- Migrate Vault page with document listing and management interface
- Migrate EnhancedDocumentUploader with progress tracking
- Migrate useSecureEncryption hook for encryption state management
- Migrate zero-knowledge encryption service with IndexedDB storage
- Implement document bundle system with automatic categorization
- Add document importance scoring and expiry tracking
- Create document sharing with encrypted access keys
- Implement document versioning with diff visualization

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Server-side encryption (all encryption happens client-side)
- Third-party storage providers (uses Supabase Storage exclusively)
- Real-time collaboration features (focus on individual document management)
- Mobile app integration (web-only implementation)
- Advanced document editing capabilities (view-only with download)

## Risks & Mitigations

- Encryption performance impact → Implement Web Workers and chunked encryption
- Key loss scenarios → Create backup phrase and guardian recovery systems
- Storage costs increase → Use compression and quota management
- Search performance → Implement efficient indexing and caching
- Security vulnerabilities → Regular audits and penetration testing
