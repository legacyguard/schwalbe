# Email Resend - Email Delivery and Notification System

- Implementation of Resend email delivery system for LegacyGuard
- Email template management and rendering system
- Delivery tracking and error handling infrastructure
- Notification management with user preferences

## Goals

- Port and enhance send-email function from Hollywood codebase
- Implement Resend API integration with proper authentication and error handling
- Create email template system with HTML/text rendering and personalization
- Build delivery tracking system with logging and analytics
- Establish notification management with user preferences and opt-out
- Ensure email security, compliance, and accessibility standards
- Integrate with existing monitoring and error reporting systems

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Custom email server implementation (use Resend service)
- Complex email automation workflows beyond basic notifications
- Marketing campaign management system
- Real-time email status updates (batch processing only)
- Third-party email service integrations beyond Resend

## Review & Acceptance

- [ ] Resend API integration configured and authenticated
- [ ] Email templates migrated from Hollywood and enhanced
- [ ] Delivery tracking system with database logging
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Notification system with user preferences
- [ ] Email security and compliance measures in place
- [ ] Performance optimization for email delivery
- [ ] Accessibility compliance for email content
- [ ] Testing scenarios validated in dev and preview environments
- [ ] Integration with monitoring and alerting systems

## Risks & Mitigations

- Email delivery failures → Implement retry logic and fallback mechanisms
- Template rendering errors → Add validation and error boundaries
- High email volume → Implement rate limiting and queuing
- User preference management → Clear UI and database constraints
- Compliance violations → Regular audits and legal review
- Performance degradation → Caching and optimization strategies

## Security & Compliance

- Secrets: Load Resend API keys via environment variables, validate at runtime (e.g., Zod), never log, and rotate regularly.
- Webhooks: If using Resend webhooks, enforce signature verification for all webhook handlers.
