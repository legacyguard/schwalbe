- `family_permissions`: Granular permission assignments

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/family/invite`: Send family member invitation
- `GET /api/family/members`: Retrieve family member list
- `POST /api/emergency/request`: Initiate emergency access request
- `PUT /api/family/permissions`: Update member permissions
- `GET /api/family/activity`: Retrieve family activity log

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Hierarchical permission system
- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**: Client-side encryption for sensitive data
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Secure invitation and access tokens
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete activity logging for legal requirements

### Emergency Protocols
- **Verification Requirements**: Multi-step verification for emergency access
- **Time-Limited Access**: Automatic expiration of emergency permissions
- **Approval Workflows**: Designated approver validation process
- **Incident Response**: Automated alerts for suspicious access patterns

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
