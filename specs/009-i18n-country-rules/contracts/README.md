## Contract Standards

All contracts follow OpenAPI 3.0 specification and include:

- Request/response schemas with TypeScript type generation
- Error handling specifications with standardized error codes
- Authentication requirements using Supabase Auth
- Rate limiting information for translation API calls
- Performance requirements (response times, bundle sizes)
- Accessibility considerations for i18n features
- Localization requirements for API error messages

## Usage

These contracts are used to:

- Generate TypeScript types for client-side i18n integration
- Validate API responses and requests in testing
- Document i18n system capabilities and limitations
- Ensure consistency across different implementation components
- Support automated testing and validation
- Provide API documentation for external integrations

## Validation

All contracts are validated against:

- OpenAPI 3.0 specification compliance
- i18n system requirements and constraints
- Performance and accessibility standards
- Security and privacy requirements
- Country rules compliance requirements
- TypeScript type generation compatibility

## Integration Points

Contracts integrate with existing systems:

- **Supabase**: Database schemas for translations and user preferences
- **Supabase Auth**: Authentication for admin translation management
- **Google Translate API**: External translation service integration
- **Next.js**: App Router and middleware integration points
- **CI/CD**: Automated validation and health checks
