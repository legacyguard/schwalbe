### **5.2 Integration Testing (`apps/web-next`)**

- Build end-to-end i18n testing scenarios
- Implement cross-language functionality tests
- Add country rule integration tests
- Create translation management integration tests
- Build accessibility testing for i18n
- Implement performance testing for i18n bundle

### **5.3 Production Readiness (`scripts/`)**

- Create i18n deployment validation scripts
- Implement production i18n health checks
- Add i18n monitoring and alerting setup
