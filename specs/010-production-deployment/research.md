## Performance: Deployment Performance Optimization

### Build Performance Optimization

**Build Time Reduction Strategies:**

```yaml
# turbo.json configuration
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "outputs": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Caching Strategies:**

- Build artifact caching
- Dependency caching
- Docker layer caching
- CDN asset caching

### Runtime Performance Optimization

**Core Web Vitals Optimization:**

```typescript
// Performance monitoring
const performanceObserver = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      trackMetric('lcp', entry.startTime);
    }
  }
});
performanceObserver.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint'] });
```

**Bundle Optimization:**

- Code splitting strategies
- Tree shaking configuration
- Asset optimization
- Lazy loading implementation

### Database Performance

**Query Optimization:**

```sql
-- Optimized deployment queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_deployments_environment_status
ON deployments(environment, status, created_at DESC);

-- Partitioning strategy
CREATE TABLE deployments_y2024 PARTITION OF deployments
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
```

**Connection Pooling:**

```typescript
// Database connection configuration
const poolConfig = {
  max: 20,
  min: 5,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
};
```

      - key: 'Content-Security-Policy'
        value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
