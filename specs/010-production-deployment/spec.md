## Goals

### Phase 13 â€” Observability, Security, and Performance Hardening Requirements

- **Supabase Observability**: Implement Supabase logs + DB error table + Resend alerts (no Sentry)
- **Security Hardening**: Deploy CSP, Trusted Types, and strict security headers
- **Automated Testing**: Enable smoke e2e on each PR with load testing for landing + key flows
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure security scan clean, performance budgets met, and alerting verified

### Core Deployment Features

- **Production Deployment**: Implement automated deployment pipeline with multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
- **Environment Management**: Establish secure environment configuration and secrets management system
- **Monitoring Setup**: Deploy comprehensive monitoring system with alerting and performance tracking
- **Security Hardening**: Implement production-grade security measures and vulnerability scanning
- **Performance Optimization**: Establish performance monitoring and optimization pipelines
- **Deployment Automation**: Create automated deployment workflows with rollback capabilities
- **Quality Assurance**: Implement automated testing and validation for production deployments

### Hollywood Integration

- **Deployment System**: Migrate and enhance Hollywood's deployment infrastructure
- **Monitoring Patterns**: Port proven monitoring and alerting patterns from Hollywood
- **Security Framework**: Integrate Hollywood's security hardening measures
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance benchmarks based on Hollywood metrics

### Specific Implementation Requirements

- **Vercel Deployment**: Implement comprehensive Vercel deployment with custom domains, SSL, and environment management
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Create automated GitHub Actions workflows with quality gates and deployment automation
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Deploy Supabase-based monitoring with real-time dashboards and alerting systems
- **Security Hardening**: Implement CSP, Trusted Types, strict headers, and vulnerability scanning
- **Performance Optimization**: Establish Core Web Vitals monitoring, load testing, and budget enforcement
- **Rollback Procedures**: Configure automated rollback mechanisms and disaster recovery procedures
- **Environment Configuration**: Implement secure environment management with secrets and configuration validation
- **Deployment Analytics**: Create comprehensive deployment tracking, reporting, and performance analytics
- **Production Readiness**: Establish production validation, health checks, and operational procedures
- **Deployment Testing**: Implement smoke tests, integration testing, and validation procedures

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Manual deployment processes (all deployments must be automated)
- Basic monitoring only (requires comprehensive observability)
- Minimal security measures (requires production-grade security)
- Single environment deployment (requires multi-environment support)
- Basic performance monitoring (requires optimization pipelines)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Deployment Risks

- **Deployment Failures**: Implement comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and automated rollback procedures
- **Environment Drift**: Use infrastructure as code and automated configuration validation
- **Downtime**: Implement blue-green deployment strategy and health check monitoring

### Monitoring Risks

- **Monitoring Gaps**: Establish comprehensive monitoring coverage with automated alerting
- **Alert Fatigue**: Implement intelligent alerting with noise reduction and prioritization
- **Data Loss**: Use redundant monitoring data storage and backup procedures

### Security Risks

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Implement automated vulnerability scanning and security testing
- **Configuration Exposure**: Use secure secrets management and access control
- **Compliance Issues**: Implement automated compliance checking and reporting

### Performance Risks

- **Performance Degradation**: Establish performance baselines and automated regression detection
- **Scalability Issues**: Implement load testing and capacity planning
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Use automated resource monitoring and scaling
