# Animations & Micro-interactions - Emotional Design System

- Implementation of Phase 7 — Emotional Core MVP animation requirements
- Night sky landing page with accessible performance budgets (60fps target)
- Sofia presence with firefly motion and guided dialog surface
- 3-act onboarding animations to reduce anxiety and celebrate clarity
- Comprehensive animation system migrated from Hollywood codebase
- Performance budgets, accessibility standards, and emotional design integration

## Goals

- Implement firefly animations with personality adaptation (empathetic, pragmatic, adaptive modes)
- Create celebration system for milestones and achievements with emotional impact
- Build comprehensive micro-interaction library for UI components
- Establish performance budgets and accessibility standards for animations
- Integrate emotional design principles throughout the animation system

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Complex 3D animations requiring heavy computation
- Video-based animations or media overlays
- Real-time rendering or game-like animation systems
- Animation systems for non-web platforms

## Review & Acceptance

- [ ] 60fps performance maintained across all animation types
- [ ] Accessibility compliance with WCAG guidelines and reduced motion support
- [ ] Emotional impact verified through user testing and qualitative feedback
- [ ] Firefly animations functional with personality adaptation
- [ ] Celebration system triggers appropriate emotional responses
- [ ] Micro-interaction library comprehensive and reusable
- [ ] Performance budgets met (<100ms animation start time)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Risks & Mitigations

- Performance degradation on low-end devices → Implement progressive enhancement and device detection
- Accessibility issues causing user discomfort → Mandatory accessibility reviews and user testing
- Animation fatigue reducing emotional impact → Implement animation variety and user controls
- Personality adaptation not resonating → User feedback loops and A/B testing
- Browser compatibility issues → Progressive enhancement and fallback strategies
