## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Error Not Being Logged

```bash
# Check error logging configuration
SELECT * FROM monitoring_configs WHERE config_type = 'error_logging';

# Verify error logs table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM error_logs WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

# Check application logs for logging errors
# Look for console errors or logging service failures
```

#### Security Alert Not Sent

```bash
# Check alert configuration
SELECT * FROM monitoring_configs WHERE config_type = 'alerting';

# Verify Resend configuration
SELECT * FROM alert_logs WHERE status = 'failed' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

# Check email service connectivity
curl -X POST https://api.resend.com/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from":"test@your-domain.com","to":"test@example.com","subject":"Test","html":"<p>Test</p>"}'
```

#### Performance Metrics Not Collecting

```bash
# Check performance monitoring configuration
SELECT * FROM monitoring_configs WHERE config_type = 'performance';

# Verify performance metrics table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM performance_metrics WHERE measured_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';

# Check Web Vitals collection
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM web_vitals WHERE measured_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

#### System Health Check Failing

```bash
# Check health check configuration
SELECT * FROM monitoring_configs WHERE config_type = 'health_check';

# Verify system health table
SELECT * FROM system_health WHERE checked_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour' ORDER BY checked_at DESC;

# Check health check endpoints manually
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
```

#### Vulnerability Scan Not Running

```bash
# Check vulnerability scan configuration
SELECT * FROM monitoring_configs WHERE config_type = 'vulnerability_scan';

# Verify scan results
SELECT * FROM vulnerability_scans ORDER BY started_at DESC LIMIT 5;

# Check CI/CD pipeline for scan execution
# Verify security scanning tools are properly configured
```
