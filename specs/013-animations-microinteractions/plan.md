- Add reduced motion preference support (prefers-reduced-motion)
- Create screen reader announcements for animation state changes
- Develop keyboard navigation support for interactive animations
- Test with assistive technologies and screen readers

### **5.3 Cross-browser Testing**

- Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (full Framer Motion support)
- Verify mobile browser compatibility and touch interactions
- Check progressive enhancement with CSS fallbacks for legacy browsers
- Validate fallback animations for unsupported environments
- Ensure consistent emotional impact across all platforms

### **5.4 Phase 7 Emotional Core Validation**

- Conduct qualitative review of night sky landing page animations
- Perform staging session replays for emotional impact measurement

- Test Sofia firefly presence and guided dialog surface
- Measure user engagement and emotional response metrics

### **5.5 Storybook Coverage & Acceptance Authoring**

- Create Storybook stories for: SofiaFirefly, MilestoneCelebration, AdaptiveProgressRing, MicroAnimation, AnimatedButton, AnimatedCard
- Cover personalities (empathetic, pragmatic, adaptive), reducedMotion on/off, performanceMode (high/balanced/low)
- Document acceptance criteria per Animation Map action (timings, FPS, memory, fallbacks)

### **5.6 Event Bus & Telemetry Mapping**

- Document event names and payloads (Trigger/Event Catalog) and emit points in apps/web-next
- Define telemetry keys (perf.animationStart, perf.fps, memory deltas) and mapping to Supabase tables per 011-monitoring-analytics
