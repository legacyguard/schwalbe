# Emotional Core MVP - Research Analysis

## Product Scope

### Core Problem Statement

Legacy planning applications traditionally focus on functional security and legal compliance, but fail to address the deep emotional barriers that prevent users from engaging with these critical life planning tasks. Users experience anxiety, avoidance, and emotional resistance when confronting mortality and legacy planning, leading to incomplete planning and family burden.

### Target User Research

**Primary Users**: Adults 25-70 preparing for life's uncertainties

- **Anxious Avoiders**: High anxiety about death/mortality, avoid planning entirely
- **Practical Planners**: Task-oriented, need emotional support during the planning process
- **Family Protectors**: Motivated by love for family, need emotional validation of their efforts
- **Legacy Builders**: Want to leave meaningful impact, seek celebratory planning experiences

**Emotional Pain Points Identified**:

1. **Mortality Anxiety**: "Thinking about death makes me anxious and depressed"
2. **Family Burden**: "I don't want to burden my family with complicated systems"
3. **Emotional Avoidance**: "I know I should plan, but it feels overwhelming"
4. **Legacy Uncertainty**: "Will my family know how much I loved them?"
5. **Technical Coldness**: "Current tools feel clinical and impersonal"

### Market Research Findings

**Competitive Analysis**:

- **Legacy Planning Services**: Focus on wills/estates, limited digital asset management, clinical interfaces
- **Password Managers**: Basic sharing capabilities, no emergency protocols, lack emotional support
- **Secure File Sharing**: Generic solutions, not family-specific, no emotional design
- **Estate Planning Software**: Expensive, complex, not user-friendly, anxiety-inducing

**Market Gap**: No solution combines emotional design, family-specific workflows, comprehensive emergency access, and anxiety-reducing user experiences.

### Success Metrics Definition

- **Emotional Impact**: ≥30% reduction in user anxiety levels
- **User Engagement**: 3x increase in session depth and interaction time
- **Conversion Improvement**: ≥25% increase in onboarding completion rates
- **Sofia Effectiveness**: ≥70% users rate guidance as "helpful"
