# Emotional Core MVP - User Experience and Engagement System

- Implementation of emotional design system for LegacyGuard user experience
- Night sky landing page with 60fps animations and Sofia presence
- 3-act onboarding flow with anxiety reduction and progress celebration
- Emotional analytics and conversion optimization framework

## Goals

- Create night sky landing page with calming animations and emotional depth
- Implement Sofia presence with context-aware firefly guidance
- Build 3-act onboarding flow that reduces anxiety and celebrates progress
- Establish emotional design patterns for trust, engagement, and conversion
- Implement emotional analytics for impact measurement and optimization
- Create conversion optimization framework with A/B testing
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) for all emotional features
- Maintain performance budgets (<150KB bundle, 60fps animations)

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Complex 3D animations or real-time particle systems
- Real-time collaboration or instant messaging features
- Social media integration or community features
- Full LLM integration (stub implementation only)
- Mobile native app development

## Review & Acceptance

- [ ] Night sky landing page with 60fps animations implemented
- [ ] Sofia presence with context-aware firefly guidance working
- [ ] 3-act onboarding flow reducing anxiety and celebrating progress
- [ ] Emotional design patterns creating trust and engagement
- [ ] Emotional analytics measuring impact and optimization opportunities
- [ ] Conversion optimization with A/B testing framework
