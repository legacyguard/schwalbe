# Business Journeys - Customer Experience and Process Optimization

- Implementation of comprehensive customer journey mapping and business process optimization
- User experience flows, conversion funnels, and journey analytics system
- Integration with Sofia AI for personalized journey guidance

## Philosophy & Brand

- **Mission**: Help families and professionals protect legacies through clear, compliant, and compassionate tools.
- **Positioning**: A practical, modern alternative to scattered legal and estate tools—unifying documents, reviews, and planning in one place.
- **Value ladder**:
  1) Organize: capture documents, assets, essentials (free tier)
  2) Understand: quick insights, time capsule snapshots, guided next steps
  3) Improve: professional reviews, consultations, personalized plans
  4) Grow: partnerships, collaboration, and compliance at scale
- **Brand promises**:
  - Clarity over complexity (plain language, explain the "why")
  - Privacy by default (minimal data, least privilege)
  - Progress you can feel (visible milestones and before/after)
- **Principles**:
  - Build components first, connect later
  - Accessibility and performance are features
  - Legal compliance by design

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Journey complexity overwhelming users** → Start with simple flows; add complexity gradually with user feedback.
- **Process automation failures** → Implement comprehensive error handling and manual fallbacks.
- **Conversion optimization backfiring** → Use proven A/B testing; monitor user satisfaction and churn.
- **Analytics privacy concerns** → Implement minimal data collection with clear consent and anonymization.
- **Mobile journey performance issues** → Optimize for mobile-first design; extensive device testing.

### Feature-specific risks

- **Journey mapping accuracy** → Validate maps with real user data and feedback.
- **Process automation reliability** → Implement monitoring and alerting for automated processes.
- **Conversion funnel analysis** → Use statistical significance testing for optimization decisions.
- **Journey analytics performance** → Implement efficient tracking with minimal impact on user experience.

## Immediate Constraints

- No "glue" between features during component build phases
- No env-based configuration until integration phases
- Documentation/specs can iterate independently of wiring
