- Basic migration testing framework

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Migration system can execute SQL scripts successfully
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented

### Phase 2: Type Generation (Week 2)

**Objective**: Implement automated TypeScript type generation from database schema

**Key Activities:**

- [ ] Types published and accessible in packages/shared

### Phase 3: Schema Validation (Week 3)

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive schema validation and integrity checks

**Key Activities:**

- Add data integrity checks and triggers
- Set up schema change validation pipeline
- Create schema documentation and change tracking

**Deliverables:**

- Schema validation framework
- Data integrity constraints and triggers
- Schema change validation pipeline
- Comprehensive schema documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Schema validation catches all constraint violations
- [ ] Data integrity maintained during operations
- [ ] Schema changes validated before deployment
- [ ] Schema documentation auto-generated and current

### Phase 4: Data Migration (Week 4)

**Objective**: Execute data migration and transformation procedures

**Key Activities:**

- Plan and sequence data migration operations
- Implement data transformation utilities
- Execute migrations with data validation
- Test rollback procedures with data integrity
- Document migration procedures and recovery steps

**Deliverables:**

- Data migration execution framework
- Data transformation and validation utilities
- Migration rollback procedures
- Comprehensive migration documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All data migrations execute successfully
- [ ] Data integrity maintained throughout migration
- [ ] Rollback procedures restore data correctly
- [ ] Migration documentation complete and tested

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Week 5)

**Objective**: Comprehensive testing and validation of database system

**Key Activities:**

- Implement comprehensive migration testing
- Create type validation test suites
- Set up database performance testing
- Execute end-to-end database workflow tests
- Validate security and RLS policies

**Deliverables:**

- Complete test suite for database operations
- Performance benchmarks and monitoring
- Security validation reports
- End-to-end testing framework

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All database tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met or exceeded
- [ ] Security policies validated and compliant
- [ ] End-to-end workflows tested and documented

## Risk Mitigation

### Migration Risks

- **Data Loss**: Implement transaction management and backup procedures
- **Downtime**: Schedule migrations during maintenance windows
- **Rollback Complexity**: Test rollback procedures extensively
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor and optimize migration performance

### Type Safety Risks

- **Type Drift**: Automate type generation and validation
- **Runtime Errors**: Implement comprehensive type guards
- **Integration Issues**: Test type compatibility across packages

### Schema Risks

- **Constraint Violations**: Validate constraints before deployment
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor query performance after changes
- **Data Corruption**: Implement integrity checks and validation
