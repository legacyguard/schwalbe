# 026 — Vault Encrypted Storage - Client-side Encryption and Secure Storage

- Implementation of secure document vault with client-side encryption
- Zero-knowledge architecture ensuring server cannot access unencrypted data
- Comprehensive key management and rotation system
- Encrypted storage with integrity verification and audit trails

## Goals

- **Client-side encryption and key management**: Implement XSalsa20-Poly1305 algorithm with PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Encrypted storage and data protection**: Establish secure storage with integrity verification and audit trails
- **Zero-knowledge implementation and privacy**: Create server isolation with client-side key management only
- **Security hardening and vulnerability scanning**: Implement comprehensive security controls and monitoring
- **Encryption testing and validation**: Build complete test suites for all encryption operations
- **Vault security and compliance**: Ensure GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA compliance with audit trails
- **Vault analytics and monitoring**: Implement privacy-preserving analytics and performance monitoring
- **Vault performance optimization**: Achieve <3s upload and <2s download for 10MB files
- **Vault accessibility and compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all encryption features
- **Vault backup and recovery**: Secure key backup and encrypted data recovery mechanisms

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Server-side encryption (client-side only)
- Hardware security modules integration
- Real-time encryption for streaming data
- Multi-party computation for shared encryption
- Third-party key escrow services

## Risks & Mitigations

- Key loss → Implement secure key backup and recovery mechanisms
- Encryption vulnerabilities → Use proven algorithms and regular security audits
- Storage breaches → Multi-layer encryption and access controls
- Performance issues → Streaming encryption and caching mechanisms
- Browser compatibility → Progressive enhancement and fallbacks
