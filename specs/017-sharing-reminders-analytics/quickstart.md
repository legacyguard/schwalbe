## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Share Link Not Working

```bash
# Check share configuration exists
SELECT * FROM sharing_config WHERE share_url LIKE '%share-id%';

# Check permissions
SELECT permissions FROM sharing_config WHERE id = 'share-id';

# Check expiry
SELECT expires_at, is_active FROM sharing_config WHERE id = 'share-id';
```

#### Reminder Not Delivered

```bash
# Check reminder rule status
SELECT * FROM reminder_rule WHERE id = 'reminder-id';

# Check notification logs
SELECT * FROM notification_logs WHERE reminder_rule_id = 'reminder-id';
```

#### Analytics Not Tracking

```bash
# Check user consent
SELECT * FROM analytics_dashboard WHERE user_id = 'user-id';

# Verify analytics events
SELECT * FROM analytics_event WHERE user_id = 'user-id' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

#### Sofia AI Not Responding

```bash
# Check OpenAI API key
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Verify API connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" https://api.openai.com/v1/models
```

This quickstart guide provides comprehensive testing scenarios for all Phase 12 components: secure public share links with audit logs and expiry, reminder scheduling via functions, privacy-first analytics, and enhanced Sofia AI with context awareness, empathy prompts, and task routing.
