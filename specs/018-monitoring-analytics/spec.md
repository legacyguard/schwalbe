# Monitoring & Analytics - Observability and Performance Tracking

- Implementation of comprehensive monitoring system for Schwalbe platform
- Real-time analytics tracking and performance metrics collection
- Error logging and alerting system with Supabase integration
- User behavior analytics and privacy-first data collection

## Goals

- Implement comprehensive monitoring system covering all platform components
- Establish real-time analytics tracking for user behavior and engagement
- Create performance metrics collection with Web Vitals monitoring
- Build error logging system with structured data and alerting
- Develop privacy-first analytics with GDPR compliance
- Integrate Supabase logs, DB error table, and Resend alerts
- Create lightweight production dashboard for health monitoring
- Establish performance budgets and automated alerting

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Third-party monitoring services (Sentry replacement with Supabase)
- Complex real-time dashboards (lightweight health monitoring only)
- Advanced analytics processing (basic event tracking and aggregation)
- External data export capabilities (internal monitoring only)
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection (rule-based alerting)

## Review & Acceptance

- [ ] Monitoring system covers all critical platform components
- [ ] Analytics tracking captures key user behavior metrics
- [ ] Performance metrics collection includes Web Vitals and custom metrics
- [ ] Error logging system with structured data and context
- [ ] Privacy-first analytics with data minimization and consent
- [ ] Supabase logs integration for database and API monitoring
- [ ] DB error table with automated alerting and escalation
- [ ] Resend alerts for critical system events and failures
- [ ] Lightweight production dashboard for health monitoring
- [ ] Performance budgets established and monitored
- [ ] GDPR compliance for analytics data collection and storage

## Risks & Mitigations

- Data privacy concerns → Implement data minimization and consent management
- Performance impact of monitoring → Use efficient buffering and batching
- Alert fatigue → Implement intelligent alerting with noise reduction
- Data accuracy issues → Establish data validation and quality checks
- Scalability challenges → Design for horizontal scaling and data partitioning
- GDPR compliance → Implement data retention policies and user controls
