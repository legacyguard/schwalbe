# Family Shield Emergency - Crisis Response and Access Control

- Implementation of comprehensive emergency access system with guardian verification and inactivity monitoring
- Secure token-based access control for family shield activation
- Automated inactivity detection with configurable thresholds and guardian notifications
- Multi-channel emergency communication and access staging

## Goals

- Migrate and enhance Hollywood emergency system components for Schwalbe
- Implement secure guardian verification and access control mechanisms
- Create automated inactivity monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Build emergency protocol activation system with multi-guardian confirmation
- Establish comprehensive audit logging for all emergency access activities
- Integrate with existing vault encryption and document access systems
- Provide survivor manual generation and emergency contact management
- Ensure compliance with privacy regulations and secure data handling

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Real-time health monitoring or medical emergency detection
- Automatic emergency service notifications (police, medical)
- Integration with external emergency response systems
- Voice-based emergency communication
- Cross-platform mobile emergency alerts

## Review & Acceptance

- [ ] Emergency access verification system migrated from Hollywood
- [ ] Guardian verification and access control implemented
- [ ] Inactivity monitoring with configurable thresholds working
- [ ] Emergency protocol activation with multi-guardian confirmation
- [ ] Secure token generation and validation system operational
- [ ] Audit logging for all emergency access activities
- [ ] Survivor manual generation and emergency contacts management
- [ ] Integration with vault encryption and document access
- [ ] Privacy compliance and secure data handling verified
- [ ] End-to-end emergency simulation testing completed

## Risks & Mitigations

- Emergency access abuse → Multi-guardian verification and audit logging
- False inactivity detection → Configurable thresholds and grace periods
- Guardian communication failures → Multi-channel notification system
- Token security vulnerabilities → Secure token generation and expiration
- Privacy data exposure → End-to-end encryption and access controls
- System availability during emergencies → Redundant systems and failover
