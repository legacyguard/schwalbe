## Key Objectives

- **Modern Architecture**: Migrate to Next.js 14+ with App Router for improved performance and developer experience
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Implement SSR/RSC patterns for optimal loading times and SEO
- **Edge Runtime**: Deploy Supabase Edge Functions for global performance
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript compliance throughout the application
- **Security**: Implement comprehensive security measures and audit logging
- **Performance**: Achieve Core Web Vitals scores >90
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling and high availability
