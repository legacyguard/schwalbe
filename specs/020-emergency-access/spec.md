# Emergency Access - Crisis Response and Document Release System

- Implementation of comprehensive emergency access system with crisis response protocols, inactivity detection, and secure document release
- Builds on Hollywood's proven emergency system with enhanced security, emotional design, and legal compliance
- Enables secure family legacy access during critical situations through controlled document release and guardian verification

## Goals

- **Emergency Activation**: Implement crisis response protocols with multiple activation triggers
- **Inactivity Detection**: Create automated monitoring system for user inactivity with configurable thresholds
- **Staged Access Control**: Build hierarchical permission system with time-limited emergency access
- **Document Release**: Establish secure document access with category-based permissions and audit trails
- **Guardian Verification**: Implement secure guardian authentication and verification system
- **Emergency Protocols**: Create configurable emergency detection rules and response actions
- **Audit & Compliance**: Implement complete audit logging for security monitoring and legal compliance
- **System Integration**: Ensure seamless integration with Document Vault, Will Creation, Sofia AI, and Family Collaboration systems

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Real-time monitoring or automatic emergency activation
- Medical emergency detection or response systems
- Third-party emergency services integration
- Mobile app development (web-only implementation)
- Video communication or real-time chat capabilities
- External API integrations beyond core Schwalbe services

## Review & Acceptance

- [ ] Emergency simulation testing completed with realistic crisis scenarios
- [ ] Access staging validated with multiple permission levels and time limits
- [ ] Document release protocols tested with secure access and audit trails
- [ ] Emergency activation triggers working for manual and automatic scenarios
- [ ] Inactivity detection algorithms accurate with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Guardian verification system secure with multi-step authentication
- [ ] System integration tested with Document Vault and Will Creation systems
- [ ] Security testing passed with emergency-specific threat modeling
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for crisis response times
- [ ] Accessibility compliance achieved for emergency user interfaces
- [ ] Legal compliance verified for emergency access and data protection

## Risks & Mitigations

- **False Activation**: Implement configurable thresholds, grace periods, and manual override mechanisms
- **Access Abuse**: Establish permission hierarchies, time limits, and activity monitoring with audit trails
- **Guardian Conflicts**: Create dispute resolution workflows and clear permission inheritance rules
- **Emergency Response Delays**: Optimize system performance and implement caching for critical paths
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Use multi-factor authentication, encrypted tokens, and comprehensive logging
- **Legal Compliance Issues**: Implement jurisdiction-aware access controls and regular legal reviews
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Ensure data minimization, transparent logging, and user consent mechanisms
- **System Reliability**: Implement redundancy, monitoring, and automated failover for emergency scenarios
