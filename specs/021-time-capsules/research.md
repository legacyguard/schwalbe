```

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (Database, Storage, Edge Functions)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- **Email**: Resend API with custom templates
- **Encryption**: TweetNaCl for client-side encryption
- **Media**: MediaRecorder API, WebRTC, Canvas API
- **State**: Zustand for client state management

### Identity & RLS Baseline Note

- Standardize on Supabase Auth for this module. If older materials mention Clerk, apply bridging per 005-auth-rls-baseline; keep Time Capsules Supabase-first.
- RLS-first design across all tables; owner-only by default, with minimal guardian access proven by joins; write positive/negative policy tests.
- Tokens must be hashed, single-use, with expires_at and used_at; never log raw tokens; URLs contain opaque tokens only.
- Observability baseline: structured logs in Supabase Edge Functions and critical email alerts via Resend; no Sentry.

## User Experience

### Creation Flow

The time capsule creation follows a 4-step wizard:

1. **Recipient Selection**: Choose existing guardian or add new recipient with relationship context
2. **Delivery Configuration**: Select date-based delivery or Family Shield emergency activation
3. **Media Recording**: In-browser video/audio recording with real-time preview and controls
4. **Review & Confirmation**: Preview capsule details, add emotional tags, and seal with animation

### Emotional Design Principles

- **Ceremony**: "Sealing" animation creates sense of significance
- **Context**: Sofia AI provides guidance and emotional support throughout
- **Progress**: Clear visual indicators reduce anxiety during creation
- **Legacy**: Emphasis on future impact and emotional connection

### Accessibility Considerations

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast
- **Cross-Device Support**: Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without advanced browser features
