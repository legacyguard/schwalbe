# Will Creation System - Legal Document Generation

- Implementation of comprehensive will generation engine with legal templates, jurisdiction compliance, and AI-assisted drafting
- Builds on Hollywood's proven will system architecture with enhanced security and user experience
- Integrates with Sofia AI for guided creation and Document Vault for secure storage

## Goals

- Migrate and enhance will generation logic from Hollywood codebase
- Implement jurisdiction-aware legal templates with version control
- Create automated clause assembly system with validation
- Build step-by-step will creation wizard with progress tracking
- Establish legal compliance checking against jurisdiction requirements
- Integrate multi-language support for international legal documents
- Implement professional PDF generation with accessibility features
- Create comprehensive testing framework with legal validation

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Complete rewrite of will generation logic (migrate and enhance existing)
- Third-party legal service integrations beyond existing templates
- Real-time legal updates (static templates with manual updates)
- Advanced tax planning (basic estate planning only)

## Review & Acceptance

- [ ] Will generation logic migrated and enhanced from Hollywood
- [ ] Jurisdiction-aware legal templates with version control implemented
- [ ] Automated clause assembly system with validation working
- [ ] Step-by-step will creation wizard with progress tracking functional
- [ ] Legal compliance checking against jurisdiction requirements operational
- [ ] Multi-language support for international legal documents available
- [ ] Professional PDF generation with accessibility features implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive testing framework with legal validation completed
- [ ] All will tables have RLS enabled; policies tested (owner vs owner’s collaborators/guardians) per 005-auth-rls-baseline
- [ ] Observability baseline: structured logs in Supabase Edge Functions; critical alerts via Resend; no Sentry
- [ ] Database schema with proper indexing and RLS policies established
- [ ] Type-safe API contracts with comprehensive validation in place

## Risks & Mitigations

- Legal compliance issues → Legal expert review and automated validation
- Jurisdiction requirement changes → Template versioning and expert monitoring
- Template update conflicts → Comprehensive testing and gradual rollout
- PDF generation performance → Optimized rendering and caching strategies
- Multi-language consistency → Translation validation and expert review
- Security vulnerabilities → Regular audits and encryption validation
- User data privacy → GDPR compliance and data minimization
- System scalability → Performance monitoring and load testing

## Baseline Notes: Identity, RLS, Observability

- Identity: Supabase Auth is the identity provider; see 005-auth-rls-baseline for conventions and any bridging guidance.
- RLS: Enable RLS on all will-related tables; default owner-only access; write positive/negative policy tests aligned with baseline patterns.
- Observability: Use structured logs in Supabase Edge Functions and critical email alerts via Resend. Do not use Sentry in this project.
