# Plan: Will Generation Engine Implementation

This plan outlines the implementation of Phase 11 â€” Will Generation Engine (Incremental) from the high-level-plan.md. The implementation focuses on migrating and enhancing the will generation system from Hollywood codebase into Schwalbe's modular architecture.

## Overview

The Will Generation Engine represents a critical component of the estate planning system, providing automated legal document generation with jurisdiction-aware templates, real-time validation, and professional PDF output. This incremental implementation builds upon existing Hollywood will system while modernizing it for Schwalbe's architecture.

## Goals

- Migrate will generation logic from Hollywood into packages/logic with comprehensive unit tests
- Implement jurisdiction-aware legal templates with version control and validation
- Create automated clause assembly system with real-time legal compliance checking
- Build step-by-step will creation wizard with progress tracking and Sofia AI integration
- Establish legal requirements database aligned with country rules from Phase 6
- Generate professional PDFs with accessibility features and digital signatures
- Implement comprehensive testing framework with legal validation and snapshot testing

## Non-Goals

- Complete rewrite of existing will generation logic (focus on migration and enhancement)
- Third-party legal service integrations beyond existing template system
- Advanced AI-powered legal drafting (stick to template-based generation)
- Real-time legal updates (static templates with manual version control)
- Mobile-specific will generation features (web-only implementation)
