## Test Automation

### Running Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all quickstart scenarios
npm run test:quickstart

# Run specific scenario
npm run test:scenario -- --scenario=family-setup

# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Generate test report
npm run test:report
```

### Test Data Management

```typescript
// Test data utilities
export class TestDataManager {
  static async setupFamilyScenario(ownerId: string): Promise<TestFamily> {
    // Create test family structure
    // Return test data references
  }

  static async cleanupTestData(ownerId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Clean up test data
    // Reset test environment
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Invitation emails not received**: Check email service configuration
2. **Permission denied errors**: Verify role assignments and RLS policies
3. **Emergency access failures**: Check verification token validity
4. **Audit log gaps**: Verify logging middleware is active
5. **Performance issues**: Check database indexes and query optimization

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check system health
curl -X GET /api/health

# View recent audit events
curl -X GET /api/family/audit?limit=10

# Check notification queue
curl -X GET /api/admin/notifications/queue

# Validate emergency protocols
curl -X GET /api/emergency/protocols/validate
```

These test scenarios provide comprehensive validation of the Family Collaboration system, ensuring all features work correctly in real-world scenarios.
