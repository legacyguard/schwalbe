# Family Collaboration - Guardian Network and Emergency Access

- Implementation of comprehensive family collaboration system with guardian network management and emergency access protocols
- Builds on Hollywood's family system with enhanced security, emotional design, and legal compliance
- Enables secure family legacy planning through collaborative document management and crisis-ready access

## Goals

- **Migrate Hollywood Family System**: Port verify-emergency-access, activate-family-shield, protocol-inactivity-checker, check-inactivity, download-emergency-document functions
- **Guardian Network Management**: Implement guardian invitation and verification system with emotional messaging and multi-step approval workflows
- **Emergency Access Protocols**: Create hierarchical role system (Admin, Collaborator, Viewer, Emergency Contact) with time-limited emergency access
- **Family Shield Implementation**: Build comprehensive family protection system with controlled access and audit trails
- **Notification & Communication**: Establish multi-channel notification system for family communications and emergency alerts
- **Audit & Compliance**: Implement complete audit logging for security monitoring and legal compliance
- **UI Flow Integration**: Create end-to-end UI flows for invite guardian → verify → simulate inactivity → controlled access
- **System Integration**: Ensure seamless integration with Document Vault, Will Creation, and Sofia AI systems

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Social media integration or public family sharing features
- Real-time chat or instant messaging capabilities
- Video calls or multimedia communication tools
- Third-party family tree services integration
- Mobile app development (web-only implementation)
- Advanced analytics or family engagement metrics
- External API integrations beyond core Schwalbe services

## Review & Acceptance

- [ ] Family management system migrated and enhanced from Hollywood
- [ ] Guardian invitation and verification system with emotional messaging
- [ ] Hierarchical role system with permission inheritance and conflict resolution
- [ ] Emergency access protocols with multi-step verification and time limits
- [ ] Comprehensive notification system with multiple delivery channels
- [ ] Complete audit logging with searchable activity feeds and compliance reporting
- [ ] Family tree visualization with relationship mapping and access indicators
- [ ] Integration with Document Vault, Will Creation, and Sofia AI systems verified
- [ ] Security testing passed with penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for family sizes up to 50 members
- [ ] Accessibility compliance achieved with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Legal compliance verified for family law requirements across target jurisdictions

## Risks & Mitigations

- Family conflicts over access permissions → Clear permission hierarchy and dispute resolution workflows
- Access abuse through compromised credentials → Multi-factor authentication and comprehensive audit logging
- Notification fatigue from excessive alerts → Intelligent notification preferences and batching
- Legal compliance across jurisdictions → Jurisdiction-aware templates and expert review
- Performance degradation with large families → Database optimization and horizontal scaling
- Emergency access false positives/negatives → Multi-step verification and regular testing
