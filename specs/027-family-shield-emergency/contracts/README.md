## Contract Standards

All contracts follow OpenAPI 3.0 specification and include:

- Request/response schemas with comprehensive validation
- Error handling specifications with error codes and messages
- Authentication requirements (JWT, API keys, multi-factor)
- Rate limiting information and burst handling
- Performance requirements and response time SLAs
- Security headers and CORS configuration
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Filtering and sorting capabilities
- Versioning strategy and backward compatibility

## Usage

These contracts are used to:

- Generate TypeScript types for client-side integration
- Validate API responses and requests in tests
- Document Family Shield Emergency system capabilities
- Ensure consistency across different implementations
- Support automated testing and validation
- Generate API documentation and client SDKs
- Maintain backward compatibility during updates

## Validation

All contracts are validated against:

- OpenAPI 3.0 specification compliance
- Family Shield Emergency system requirements
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Security and privacy standards
- GDPR and data protection regulations
- Accessibility and usability guidelines

## Implementation Notes

### Authentication

- JWT tokens with role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- API key authentication for system integrations
