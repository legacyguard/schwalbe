# Family Shield Emergency - Quickstart Scenarios

## 1) Emergency Setup - Configure Emergency System

### Scenario: New user sets up Family Shield

- User navigates to Family Shield settings â†’ Emergency configuration
- User enables Family Shield and sets inactivity period to 6 months
- User adds first guardian with emergency permissions
- User configures emergency contacts and survivor manual settings
- System validates guardian email and sends verification
- User receives confirmation that Family Shield is active

### 1.1 Validation Points

- [ ] Family Shield settings page loads correctly
- [ ] Inactivity period configuration works
- [ ] Guardian addition and verification process functions
- [ ] Emergency contacts can be added and prioritized
- [ ] Survivor manual settings are configurable
- [ ] System sends verification emails to guardians
- [ ] Family Shield activation confirmation is received

## 2) Guardian Testing - Test Guardian Verification

### Scenario: Guardian receives and verifies access

- Guardian receives Family Shield verification email
- Guardian clicks verification link and enters verification code
- System validates guardian identity and permissions
- Guardian gains access to emergency information
- System logs guardian verification event
- Guardian can view permitted emergency documents

### 2.1 Validation Points

- [ ] Guardian verification email is sent correctly
- [ ] Verification link works and loads verification page
- [ ] Verification code validation functions
- [ ] Guardian permissions are correctly applied
- [ ] Access logging captures verification event
- [ ] Guardian can access permitted emergency information

## 3) Inactivity Testing - Test Inactivity Detection

### Scenario: System detects user inactivity

- User stops logging in for configured period (6 months)
- System detects inactivity and sends user warning
- User doesn't respond within grace period (7 days)
- System notifies guardians of potential emergency
- Guardians receive emergency alert notifications
- System prepares emergency access tokens

### 3.1 Validation Points

- [ ] Inactivity detection monitors user activity correctly
- [ ] User warning is sent at appropriate time
- [ ] Grace period is respected before guardian notification
- [ ] Guardian notifications are sent via configured channels
- [ ] Emergency access tokens are generated
- [ ] System logs all inactivity detection events

## 4) Access Control Testing - Test Access Control

### Scenario: Guardian accesses emergency documents

- Guardian uses emergency access token
- System validates token and guardian permissions
- Guardian views emergency contact information
- Guardian downloads permitted documents
- System logs all access attempts and downloads
- Access token expires after configured time

### 4.1 Validation Points

- [ ] Emergency access token validation works
- [ ] Guardian permissions control document access
- [ ] Emergency contacts are displayed correctly
- [ ] Document download respects permissions
- [ ] All access activities are logged
- [ ] Token expiration functions correctly

## 5) Emergency Simulation - Test Emergency Flow

### Scenario: Complete emergency activation

- Multiple guardians trigger emergency protocol
- System requires minimum guardian confirmations
- Emergency protocol activates successfully
- All guardians receive access tokens
- Survivors can access emergency information
- System maintains complete audit trail

### 5.1 Validation Points

- [ ] Multi-guardian confirmation workflow works
- [ ] Emergency protocol activation succeeds
- [ ] Access tokens are distributed to all guardians
- [ ] Survivor access functions correctly
- [ ] Complete audit trail is maintained
- [ ] Emergency deactivation works properly

## 6) Family Shield Testing - Test Family Shield

### Scenario: Family Shield protects user data

- User has configured Family Shield with multiple guardians
- Emergency situation occurs
- Guardians coordinate to access protected information
- System ensures only authorized access
- All activities are logged for compliance
- Family Shield deactivates when appropriate

### 6.1 Validation Points

- [ ] Family Shield configuration is comprehensive
- [ ] Guardian coordination works smoothly
- [ ] Access controls prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Audit logging is complete and accurate
- [ ] System maintains security throughout emergency
- [ ] Shield deactivation functions correctly

## 7) Security Testing - Test Emergency Security

### Scenario: Security measures protect emergency system

- Attempted unauthorized access is blocked
- Token tampering is detected and prevented
- Guardian verification prevents impersonation
- All security events are logged
- System maintains integrity during attacks
- Security monitoring alerts on suspicious activity

### 7.1 Validation Points

- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts are blocked
- [ ] Token security measures function
- [ ] Guardian verification is secure
- [ ] Security events are properly logged
- [ ] System integrity is maintained
- [ ] Security monitoring works correctly

## 8) Performance Testing - Test Emergency Performance

### Scenario: Emergency system handles load

- Multiple emergency activations occur simultaneously
- System processes guardian notifications quickly
- Document downloads complete within acceptable time
- Audit logging doesn't impact performance
- System scales with increased emergency load
- Performance monitoring provides insights

### 8.1 Validation Points

- [ ] System handles concurrent emergency activations
- [ ] Guardian notifications are sent quickly
- [ ] Document downloads are performant
- [ ] Audit logging doesn't degrade performance
- [ ] System scales appropriately
- [ ] Performance monitoring provides useful data

## 9) Rollback Testing - Test Emergency Rollback

### Scenario: Emergency activation is cancelled

- Emergency activation is initiated
- User or guardian cancels activation
- System rolls back emergency state
- Access tokens are invalidated
- Audit trail reflects cancellation
- System returns to normal state

### 9.1 Validation Points

- [ ] Emergency cancellation works correctly
- [ ] System rollback functions properly
- [ ] Access tokens are invalidated
- [ ] Cancellation is logged in audit trail
- [ ] System returns to pre-emergency state
- [ ] No residual emergency state remains

## 10) End-to-End Test - Complete Emergency Workflow

### Scenario: Full emergency response workflow

- User becomes inactive for threshold period
- System sends warnings and guardian alerts
- Guardians verify and access emergency information
- Survivors use emergency contacts and documents
- System maintains security and audit trail
- Emergency resolves and system normalizes

### 10.1 Validation Points

- [ ] Complete workflow from inactivity to resolution
- [ ] All system components work together
- [ ] Security is maintained throughout
- [ ] Audit trail is complete and accurate
- [ ] User experience is smooth and intuitive
- [ ] System performance meets requirements
