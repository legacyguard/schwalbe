### Core pricing strategy components

- **Tiered Subscription Model**: Free, Essential, Family, Premium, Enterprise plans with clear value progression.

- **Conversion Optimization**: A/B testing, pricing psychology, and personalized upgrade prompts.
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe Checkout, Payment Links, and subscription management.
- **Analytics & Tracking**: Conversion funnels, pricing experiments, and customer behavior analysis.

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Implementing cryptocurrency payments or alternative payment methods.
- Building complex financial reporting or accounting features.
- Creating marketplace or multi-tenant billing systems.
- Implementing international payment methods beyond Stripe's supported regions.

Note: Focus on Stripe-native features and proven conversion optimization patterns. Avoid over-engineering pricing logic that can be handled by Stripe's built-in capabilities.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Payment failures** → Implement comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and fallback mechanisms.

- **Pricing sensitivity** → A/B test all pricing changes; monitor customer feedback and conversion rates.
- **Stripe integration failures** → Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms.
- **Mobile payment experience issues** → Test extensively on mobile devices; optimize for mobile-first design.

### Feature-specific risks

- **Usage tracking accuracy** → Implement robust metering with audit trails and reconciliation.
- **Subscription state management** → Use Stripe webhooks as source of truth; implement idempotent operations.
- **Pricing experiment contamination** → Implement proper user segmentation and experiment isolation.
- **Mobile payment security** → Follow PCI DSS best practices; use Stripe's secure payment methods.
