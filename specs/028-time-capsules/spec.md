### Phase 2G — Time Capsule Plan (Legacy Features)

- **Versioned Snapshots**: Introduce stored JSON snapshots of key entities (documents, settings) with timestamp and label
- **Legacy Views**: Create UI for browsing, diffing, and restoring legacy content with read-only access
- **Deferred Database Strategy**: Use localStorage/in-memory for initial demo, Supabase tables for production
- **Minimal UI Implementation**: Snapshot button, history list, and diff view stub for user validation
- **Adoption Sequence**: Start with professional application snapshots, extend to directory filters/preferences, then documents
- **Data Shape Stability**: Implement adapters and version stamps to handle data drift risks
- **User Guidance**: Clear confirm dialogs and read-only access to prevent confusion

### Time Capsule Security & Privacy

- **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**: Client-side encryption ensuring server cannot access content
- **Access Token Security**: Time-limited, UUID-based tokens for secure capsule viewing
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular permissions with revocation capabilities and audit trails
- **Guardian Verification**: Multi-step authentication for emergency access scenarios
- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation between user data and secure access controls
- **Compliance Standards**: GDPR compliance with data minimization and user consent mechanisms

### Time Capsule Analytics & Monitoring

- **Usage Analytics**: Creation patterns, delivery success rates, and user engagement metrics
- **Emotional Impact Tracking**: Recipient responses and legacy value perception measurements
- **Performance Monitoring**: Video processing times, delivery success rates, and system reliability
- **Security Monitoring**: Access patterns, potential security incidents, and threat detection
- **Business Intelligence**: Feature adoption rates, user retention impact, and optimization insights
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Administrative monitoring with alerting and performance tracking

### Time Capsule Performance Optimization

- **Video Processing Efficiency**: Web Workers for background encryption and compression
- **Streaming Uploads**: Progressive file uploads with chunking and resume capabilities
- **Caching Strategies**: Intelligent caching for thumbnails, metadata, and frequently accessed content
- **Mobile Optimization**: Battery-efficient processing and offline capability management
- **CDN Integration**: Global content delivery for optimal viewing performance
- **Resource Management**: Memory optimization and CPU utilization monitoring

### Time Capsule Accessibility & Compliance

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and high contrast modes
- **Video Accessibility**: Audio descriptions, captions, and alternative formats for video content
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Consistent experience across browsers, devices, and assistive technologies
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language support with proper RTL and localization handling
- **Legal Compliance**: Jurisdiction-aware access controls and data protection regulations
- **Inclusive Design**: Age-appropriate interfaces and cognitive accessibility considerations

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Real-time video calls or live streaming capabilities
- Social media integration or public capsule sharing
- Third-party video processing or advanced editing tools
- Multi-language video recording (English only initially)
- Real-time collaboration on capsule creation
