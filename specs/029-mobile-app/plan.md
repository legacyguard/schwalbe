## Phase 4: Push Notifications (Week 4)

### **4.1 Notification System (`apps/mobile`)**

- Set up Expo Notifications infrastructure
- Implement notification permissions and settings
- Create notification scheduling and management
- Add rich notifications with actions
- Implement emergency notification system
- Create notification preferences UI

### **4.2 Alert Management (`apps/mobile`)**

- Add notification history and management
- Implement alert categorization and prioritization
- Create notification delivery tracking
- Add notification analytics and reporting
- Implement notification batching and optimization
- Create notification testing and debugging tools

## Phase 5: Biometric Security (Week 5)

### **5.1 Fingerprint Auth (`apps/mobile`)**

- Implement fingerprint authentication
- Add fingerprint enrollment and verification
- Create fingerprint fallback mechanisms
- Implement fingerprint security policies
- Add fingerprint error handling and recovery
- Create fingerprint usage analytics

### **5.2 Face ID Auth (`apps/mobile`)**

- Implement Face ID authentication
- Add Face ID enrollment and verification
- Create Face ID fallback mechanisms
