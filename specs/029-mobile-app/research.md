## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Framework & Platform Selection

#### Recommendation: React Native + Expo

**Pros:**

- Single codebase for iOS and Android
- Rich ecosystem of native modules
- Over-the-air updates capability
- Simplified development workflow
- Strong TypeScript support
- Excellent documentation and community

**Cons:**

- Platform-specific limitations
- Bundle size considerations
- Native module maintenance overhead

**Alternatives Considered:**

- Flutter: Strong performance but steeper learning curve
- Native iOS/Android: Maximum performance but duplicate effort
- Capacitor/Ionic: Web technologies but native feel limitations

### State Management Strategy

#### Recommendation: Zustand + React Query

**Rationale:**

- Lightweight and performant for mobile
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Built-in persistence middleware
- Server state management with React Query
- Minimal boilerplate compared to Redux

**Implementation Pattern:**

```typescript
// Store with persistence
interface AppState {
  user: User | null;
  documents: Document[];
  isOnline: boolean;
}

const useAppStore = create<AppState>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // State and actions
    }),
    {
      name: 'app-storage',
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => AsyncStorage),
    }
  )
);
```

### Offline Architecture Implementation

**Core Requirements:**

- Document access without internet connectivity
- Emergency access functionality offline
- Data synchronization with conflict resolution
- Background sync capabilities

**Recommended Solution:**

- **AsyncStorage + SQLite**: Hybrid storage for different data types
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback
- **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connectivity returns
- **Conflict Resolution**: User-guided conflict resolution UI

**Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
// Offline queue management
class OfflineManager {
  private queue: SyncOperation[] = [];

  async enqueue(operation: SyncOperation) {
    this.queue.push(operation);
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('sync-queue', JSON.stringify(this.queue));
  }

  async processQueue() {
    if (!this.isOnline) return;

    for (const operation of this.queue) {
      try {
        await this.executeOperation(operation);
        this.queue.shift();
      } catch (error) {
        // Handle sync failures
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Architecture

### Biometric Authentication

**Implementation Strategy:**

- Expo LocalAuthentication for cross-platform support
- SecureStore for key storage in Secure Enclave
- Fallback to PIN/password for unsupported devices
- Session management with biometric timeout

**Security Considerations:**

- Hardware-backed key storage
- Biometric data never leaves device
- Secure key derivation from biometric authentication
- Certificate pinning for API communications

### Data Encryption

**Client-Side Encryption:**

- TweetNaCl for symmetric encryption
- PBKDF2 for key derivation from user passphrase
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Encrypted storage in SecureStore

**Key Management:**

```typescript
class KeyManager {
  private static instance: KeyManager;

  async generateMasterKey(passphrase: string): Promise<string> {
    const salt = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('encryption-salt');
    return await pbkdf2(passphrase, salt, 10000, 32, 'sha256');
  }

  async encryptDocument(content: string, key: string): Promise<string> {
    const nonce = randomBytes(24);
    const encrypted = secretbox(content, nonce, key);
    return base64encode(nonce + encrypted);
  }
}
```

    shouldShowAlert: true,
    shouldPlaySound: true,
    shouldSetBadge: true,
  }),
});

// Request permissions
const { status } = await Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync();

// Schedule notification
await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: 'Document Ready',
    body: 'Your will has been generated successfully',
  },
