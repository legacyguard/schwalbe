- **Response Time Monitoring**: Track and optimize response times for better user experience

### Animation Performance
- **CSS Transforms**: Use hardware-accelerated CSS transforms for smooth animations
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Proper animation timing for consistent frame rates
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track animation performance and adjust quality as needed
- **Device Adaptation**: Adjust animation complexity based on device capabilities

### Memory Management
- **Conversation History**: Efficient storage and retrieval of conversation data
- **Pattern Learning**: Optimized storage and processing of user behavior patterns
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old or irrelevant data
- **Privacy Controls**: User control over what data is stored and for how long

## Accessibility & Inclusion

### AI Interaction Accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Sofia responses are properly announced by screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for Sofia chat interface
- **High Contrast**: Sofia animations and text work with high contrast themes
