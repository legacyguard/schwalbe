# Sofia AI System - Emotional Intelligence Core

- Implementation of Sofia AI as the emotional intelligence core of LegacyGuard
- Context-aware guidance system with adaptive personality and firefly animations
- Proactive assistance and milestone celebration system

## Goals

- Migrate and enhance Sofia AI core logic from Hollywood codebase
- Implement adaptive personality system with empathetic, pragmatic, and adaptive modes
- Create context-aware guidance system for different app sections
- Build firefly animation system with physics and emotional responses
- Implement celebration animations and milestone system
- Establish proactive suggestion engine based on user behavior
- Create Sofia memory system for persistent user context
- Integrate with existing emotion detection and response patterns

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Complete rewrite of AI logic (migrate and enhance existing)
- Third-party AI service integrations beyond existing OpenAI/Anthropic
- Real-time voice interaction (text-based only)
- Multi-language AI responses (English only initially)

## Review & Acceptance

- [ ] Sofia AI core logic migrated and enhanced from Hollywood
- [ ] Adaptive personality system with three modes implemented
- [ ] Context-aware guidance system working across all app sections
- [ ] Firefly animation system with physics and emotional responses
- [ ] Celebration animations and milestone system functional
- [ ] Proactive suggestion engine based on user behavior patterns
- [ ] Sofia memory system for persistent user context
- [ ] Integration with existing emotion detection patterns
- [ ] Performance optimization for AI responses and animations
- [ ] Accessibility compliance for AI interactions and animations

## Risks & Mitigations

- AI response latency → Implement caching and progressive loading
- Animation performance → Use CSS transforms and requestAnimationFrame
- Memory system complexity → Start with simple localStorage, migrate to indexedDB
- Personality adaptation accuracy → Implement A/B testing and feedback loops
- Context awareness accuracy → Use multiple context sources and fallbacks
