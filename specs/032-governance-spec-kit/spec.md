# Governance Spec Kit - Project Management and Documentation System

- Implementation of comprehensive governance system for Schwalbe development
- Integration of spec-kit workflow, Linear project management, and PR discipline
- Documentation management and quality assurance framework

## Goals

- Establish spec-kit governance system for project management and documentation
- Implement Linear integration for issue tracking and project coordination
- Create PR discipline framework with templates and quality gates
- Build documentation management system with standards and maintenance
- Develop governance testing and compliance validation
- Ensure governance security, accessibility, and performance optimization

## Non-Goals (out of scope)

- Complete project management platform replacement
- Third-party tool integrations beyond Linear
- Real-time collaboration features
- Enterprise governance frameworks
- Advanced analytics beyond basic metrics

## Review & Acceptance

- [ ] Spec-kit governance system implemented and functional
- [ ] Linear integration working for project management

- [ ] Documentation management system with standards
- [ ] Governance testing and compliance validation
- [ ] Governance security measures implemented

## Risks & Mitigations

- PR quality issues → Implement automated quality gates and review templates
- Linear integration complexity → Start with basic integration, expand incrementally
- Performance impact → Optimize governance processes and caching
