  {
    name: t('plans.premium.name'),
    features: t('plans.premium.features', { returnObjects: true }) as string[]
  }
]
```

#### Dynamic Content Translation
```typescript
// Example from Professional Directory  
{t('modal.credentials.yearsInPractice', { count: experience_years })}
{t('professionalCard.statesCount', { count: licensed_states?.length })}
```

#### Conditional Translation Keys
```typescript
// Example from Family Legacy
{isProject ? t('projects.active') : t('projects.planning')}
```
