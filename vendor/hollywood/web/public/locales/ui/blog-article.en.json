      "title": "Why This Matters",
      "text": "Creating a will isn't about dwelling on the end—it's about ensuring your family's future is secure and your wishes are respected. It's one of the most caring things you can do for the people you love most."
    }
  },
  "reason1": {
    "title": "1. Protect Your Family's Financial Future",
    "p1": "Without a will, your assets may not be distributed according to your wishes. State laws (intestacy laws) will determine who gets what, which could leave your family in a difficult financial situation or result in assets going to unintended beneficiaries.",
    "p2": "A properly drafted will ensures that your hard-earned assets—whether it's your home, savings, investments, or personal belongings—go to the people you care about most. It also helps minimize the financial burden on your family during an already difficult time.",
    "example": {
      "title": "Real Example",
      "text": "Sarah's father passed without a will. His $500,000 estate went through probate for 18 months, with 40% going to legal fees and taxes. With proper planning, Sarah could have received the full inheritance much sooner."
    }
  },
  "reason2": {
    "title": "2. Ensure Your Children Are Cared For",
    "p1": "If you have minor children, a will is absolutely essential. It allows you to name guardians who will care for your children if something happens to both parents. Without this designation, the courts will decide who raises your children—and it might not be the person you would have chosen.",
    "p2": "You can also establish trusts for your children's education, healthcare, and general welfare. This ensures that any inheritance is used for their benefit and protection, rather than being given to them all at once when they might not be ready to manage it responsibly.",
    "guardianSelection": {
      "title": "Guardian Selection",
      "bullets": [
        "Choose someone who shares your values",
        "Consider their financial stability",
        "Discuss the responsibility with them",
        "Name backup guardians"
      ]
    },
    "trustBenefits": {
      "title": "Trust Benefits",
      "bullets": [
        "Control when children receive money",
        "Protect assets from creditors",
        "Ensure funds are used appropriately",
        "Provide for special needs"
      ]
    }
  },
  "reason3": {
    "title": "3. Avoid Family Conflicts and Legal Battles",
    "p1": "Family disputes over inheritance are unfortunately common and can tear families apart. A clear, well-drafted will eliminates ambiguity and reduces the likelihood of conflicts. It provides your family with clear instructions about your wishes, preventing misunderstandings and disagreements.",
    "p2": "Even in families with good relationships, the stress and grief of losing a loved one can lead to disagreements about 'what they would have wanted.' A will removes this uncertainty and gives your family peace of mind knowing they're following your exact wishes.",
    "card": {
      "title": "Protect Family Harmony",
      "text": "Your will isn't just about money—it's about preserving family relationships. Clear instructions prevent the kind of conflicts that can last for generations."
    }
  },
  "reason4": {
    "title": "4. Reduce Legal Costs and Speed Up the Process",
    "p1": "Dying without a will (intestate) means your estate must go through probate court, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and emotionally draining for your family. Legal fees, court costs, and other expenses can significantly reduce what your family ultimately receives.",
    "p2": "A well-planned estate can often avoid probate entirely or streamline the process significantly. This means your family gets access to your assets much faster, and more of your wealth goes to them rather than to legal fees and court costs.",

  },
  "reason5": {
    "title": "5. Express Your Personal Wishes and Values",
    "p1": "A will is about more than just money—it's your final opportunity to express your values, beliefs, and wishes. You can specify how you want to be remembered, what causes you want to support, and how you want your legacy to live on.",
    "p2": "Whether it's leaving a portion of your estate to charity, creating educational funds for future generations, or simply ensuring that sentimental items go to the right people, a will allows you to make a lasting impact that reflects who you are and what matters to you.",
    "card": {
      "title": "Legacy Beyond Money",
      "text": "Consider including personal letters, family stories, or specific instructions about how you want certain items to be used or remembered. This creates a meaningful connection for future generations."
