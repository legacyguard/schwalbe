# Interactive Living Garden System

## Overview

The Interactive Living Garden is the enhanced version of the LegacyGuard garden visualization system, implementing the "Interactive Garden" enhancement request. This system transforms the static garden into a truly living, breathing environment where users can watch their legacy grow and celebrate milestones in real-time.

## Core Features

### üçÉ Subtle Continuous Animations
- **Gentle leaf movement**: Tree leaves sway naturally in the breeze with personality-aware motion patterns
- **Organic animation**: Different intensities and patterns based on Sofia's personality mode:
  - **Empathetic**: More organic, gentle movements with higher amplitude
  - **Pragmatic**: Efficient, structured movements with precise timing  
  - **Adaptive**: Balanced natural curves with medium intensity

### ‚ú® Sofia Firefly Companion
- **Floating Sofia**: A friendly firefly representation of Sofia that continuously floats around the garden
- **Interactive companion**: Click the firefly for a small celebration surprise
- **Personality-aware paths**: Flight patterns adapt to user's personality mode:
  - **Empathetic**: Heart-like, gentle curves with longer flight times
  - **Pragmatic**: Efficient rectangular patterns with structured timing
  - **Adaptive**: Natural organic paths with balanced movement

### üéâ Milestone Celebrations
- **Firefly swarm celebrations**: When users achieve milestones, multiple celebration fireflies appear and scatter beautifully
- **Branch glow effects**: Newly achieved elements get subtle glow animations to draw attention
- **Real-time feedback**: Immediate visual celebration of user progress and achievements

## Components

### `InteractiveGardenEnhancements`
Main orchestration component that adds all interactive features to any garden visualization.

```tsx
<InteractiveGardenEnhancements
  showLeafMovement={true}
  showSofiaFirefly={true}
  showCelebrations={true}
  personalityMode="adaptive"
  onFireflyClick={() => console.log('Sofia clicked!')}
/>
```

### `TreeLeaf`
Individual animated leaf component with wind-like movement:
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility
- Personality-aware animation parameters
- Randomized delay and positioning for organic feel

### `SofiaFirefly`
The floating Sofia companion:
- Continuous organic flight patterns
- Interactive click handling
- Subtle glow effects and pulsing animation
- Graceful fallback for reduced motion

### `CelebrationFirefly`
Individual celebration fireflies for milestone achievements:
- Scattered emergence from milestone location
- Organic flight paths with rotation and scaling
- Auto-cleanup after animation completion

### `MilestoneGlow`
Subtle glow effect for newly achieved elements:
- Multiple intensity levels (subtle, medium, bright)
- Personality-aware color schemes
- Temporary highlighting that fades gracefully

## Enhanced LegacyGardenVisualization

The main `LegacyGardenVisualization` component has been enhanced with new props:

```tsx
<LegacyGardenVisualization
  // ... existing props
  showInteractiveEnhancements={true}
  recentlyCompletedMilestones={['new_milestone']}
  onSofiaFireflyClick={() => handleFireflyInteraction()}
/>
```

## Accessibility Compliance

All animations respect accessibility standards:

- **Reduced Motion**: Full support for `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media query
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Static alternatives when motion is disabled
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader Friendly**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient animations that don't impact core functionality

## Personality Integration

The system deeply integrates with Sofia's personality system:

### Empathetic Mode
- Gentle, heart-shaped flight patterns for Sofia firefly
- Longer animation durations for contemplative feel
- Warmer, more organic leaf movements
- Brighter celebration effects with pink/green themes

### Pragmatic Mode  
- Efficient, rectangular flight patterns
- Shorter, more structured animation timing
- Precise leaf movements with lower amplitude
- Subdued celebrations with blue/steel themes

### Adaptive Mode
- Balanced organic flight patterns
- Medium timing and intensity for all animations
- Natural leaf movements with moderate amplitude
- Harmonious celebrations with purple/violet themes

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Rendering**: Uses Framer Motion's optimized animation system
- **Smart Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of celebration effects to prevent memory leaks
- **Reduced Motion**: Zero animation overhead when motion is disabled
- **Conditional Loading**: Interactive enhancements only load when enabled

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```tsx
import { LegacyGardenVisualization } from '@/components/garden';

<LegacyGardenVisualization
  documentsCount={5}
  familyMembersCount={3}
  showInteractiveEnhancements={true}
  personalityMode="adaptive"
  onSofiaFireflyClick={() => {
    toast('Sofia says hello! ‚ú®');
  }}
/>
```

### Custom Celebration Handling
```tsx
const [recentMilestones, setRecentMilestones] = useState([]);

const handleNewMilestone = (milestone) => {
  setRecentMilestones([milestone]);
  setTimeout(() => setRecentMilestones([]), 2000);
};

<LegacyGardenVisualization
  // ... other props
  recentlyCompletedMilestones={recentMilestones}
  showInteractiveEnhancements={true}
/>
```

### Testing Component
Use `InteractiveGardenTest` for development and testing:

```tsx
import { InteractiveGardenTest } from '@/components/garden/InteractiveGardenTest';

<InteractiveGardenTest />
```

## Architecture

The Interactive Living Garden follows the established LegacyGuard patterns:

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with strict mode compliance
- **Framer Motion**: High-performance animations with accessibility support
- **Personality Integration**: Deep integration with Sofia's personality system
- **Modular Design**: Composable components that can be used independently
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG compliant with reduced motion support

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed for easy extension:

- **Seasonal Themes**: Weather patterns that change with seasons
- **Achievement Varieties**: Different celebration types for different milestone categories
- **Audio Integration**: Optional sound effects for celebrations (accessibility compliant)
- **Custom Elements**: Support for user-uploaded garden elements
- **Multiplayer Celebrations**: Shared celebrations when family members achieve milestones

## Integration Points

The Interactive Living Garden integrates seamlessly with:

- **Dashboard**: Primary display location for the living garden
- **Progress System**: Automatic milestone detection and celebration
- **Sofia AI**: Personality-aware animation and interaction patterns
- **Accessibility System**: Respects all user accessibility preferences
- **Animation System**: Uses centralized animation configuration
- **Theme System**: Adapts to light/dark themes automatically
